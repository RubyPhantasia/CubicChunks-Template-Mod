To set this mod up, you should just need to download/clone the repo, then import the repo's folder into IntelliJ.
E.g.:
1. Download the .zip from GitHub
2. Extract the .zip, and rename the resultant folder whatever you want
3. Open up IntelliJ and tell it to open the folder as a project
4. Wait for Intellij to finish setting up.
